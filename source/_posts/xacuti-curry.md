It looks a little messy but it tastes delicious. A Goan curry to make with any kind of meat!

## Assumptions
1. This recipe is for cooking with 1/2 a kilogram of Chicken
2. You should have some Xacuti masala on hand.
   - The Masala has all the spices you need to make the curry. You can find it from a friendly Goan (in India or anywhere else in the world!).
   - Alternatively you can make some yourself. [Get Started Here](https://www.google.com/search?q=xacuti+masala+powder+recipe)
3. This is a hot level of spice. It can be changed by:
   - Adding less or more of the masala
   - Adding less or more chilli


## Ingredients
1. 500 grams of chicken (or any meat)
2. 1 tablespoon of Vinegar
3. 1 big onion
4. 3 green chillies
5. 1 teaspoon of ginger paste
6. 1 teaspoon of garlic paste
7. 3/4 tablespoon of Xacuti masala
8. 2 - 5 potatoes (it depends on how much you want or like potatoes)
9. 1/4 cup [Ayam's Coconut Powder](https://ayam.com/coconut-regular/coconut-milk-powder.html)
   - Available from Woolworths and Coles Supermarkets


## Marinating the Chicken
1. Cut the chicken into cubes and put it into a bowl
   - One measure of the cube size is a quarter of your closed palm.
2. Add 1 Tablespoon of Vinegar into the bowl
   - Alternatively Lime or Lemon Juice
3. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the bowl
   - You can always add more salt later and other ingredient usually contain salt too.
4. Mix it all up
5. Marinate for an hour (minimum 30 minutes but longer is always better)


## Making the Curry 
1. Chop 1 big (or 2 small onions) finely
   - Finely in this case means horizontal and vertical slices
2. Cut 3 green chillies
3. (Option: Potatoes) Cut potatoes into cubes a little bit smaller than the chicken
   - Make the cubes too *big* and it won't cook in time
   - Make the cubes too *small* and it will disintegrate in the curry
4. Fry the onions and the chilli
   - Make sure to use a pot or large vessel right away, you'll be making the final curry in it.
5. Add 1 teaspoon of Ginger and Garlic paste (or powder, or the real thing)
6. Fry until the onions become transparent / glossy
7. Add 3/4 tablespoon of Xacuti masala (only once the onions are glossy!)
8. Fry the masala for 2 minutes
9. Add the bowl of chicken
10. Fry the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes
    - Meaning move it around and mix the masala and chicken together
    - Make sure that everything is coated in the masala
12. Put the lid of the pot and put it on a slow fire
13. Wait for water to come out of the chicken
    - Water comes out of the chicken
    - Water also comes from the condensation on he lid of the pot
14. (Option: Potatoes) Add the Potatoes when there is a little of of water in the pan
15. After waiting 5 minutes if you find there isn't enough water and ingredients are burning add some Boiled Hot water
16. (While you're waiting) Mix 1/4 cup of [Ayam's Coconut Powder](https://ayam.com/coconut-regular/coconut-milk-powder.html) and 3/4 water into a cup.
    1.  **NOTE:** Make sure that you add a little coconut powder first (1 teaspoon) pour some water and mix it, then add the rest of the powder and water
    2.  This ensure that there aren't any lumps in the mix
17. Crush any lumps you find Coconut Powder mix.
18. Add the Coconut Powder mix a few minutes after you put the chicken in. (Make sure there is some water in the pot)
19. Cook on low fire for 15 - 20 minutes
    - Make sure there is enough water / curry for it to simmer without burning
20. (While Cooking) Add water if there isn't enough to stop ingredients from burning
21. Ensure the chicken and potatoes (if you added them) are cooked.
22. Add Salt to the curry as needed.
